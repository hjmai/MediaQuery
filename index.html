                    My name is Jonathan Mai. I am a California State University, Fullerton
                    Computer Science graduate of class 2017. I enjoy several things that has
                    to do with coding, particularly being full stack web development. I am
                    currently working at a start up company in the real estate industry as
                    a software dev tester. I currently write several automation scripts to
                    help run end to end testing. Although this isn't something that I originally
                    intended to do, it has been a great experience and my end goal is to become
                    a full stack engineer at the company. On my off time, I enjoy playing computer
                    games and photography. I mainly play Overwatch but I am open to trying out
                    other games. In the past, I have coded my own photography website to host
                    my own images on AWS but I eventually plan to clean that up by applying a
                    lot of the skills that I learn in the UCI Coding Bootcamp. If there are any
                    suggestions to help improve my website, I am more than happy to hear them!
